                Some observations to note regarding this figure are first what we are looking at is esssentially
                a plot depicting some 500+ cities and on a specific date listed in the title, the max temperature in those 
                cities identified here by their latitudes (although without a longitude coordinate the city wouldn't exist.)
                What stands out is the maximum temperatures in regards to the equator, 0 degress latitude, the center or the 
                dividing point of the no`rthern and southern Hemispheres. With that being said, much can be extrapolated here.  
                Around the equator we see what I would say is a cluster of the higher end of the max temperatures and that is 
                the case (excluding outliers) for about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. These max temps, although the
                exact values are in our data in weather_df.html, seem to range from the high 60's to approximately 90 degrees (F),
                an intelligent visually based assumption using the plot as my reference. There are some rather high, but only few 
                in nummber max temperatures around -20 to -40 degrees latitude, as well as some low outliers around -10 to -30 deg
                latitude.  What is interesting is that we see a continual and clustered decreasing trend as move north of the equator,
                into the postitive values on the x-axis, that seems to continually decrease although widenes in latitudinal range 
                from approximately 25 deg tp 80 deg latitude.  I is interesting to see this trend which doesn't occur to the South of 
                the equator when speaking about the cities we are looking at. So it would be a safe and sound assumption to say more 
                of the sample were cities in the Northern Hemispher and that these particular locales get colder as we move further north.
                Some of the maximum temperatures are bewo 50 degrees and declining quickly.  The cities may have been chosen to establish this
                based on the plot and hence this pattern? That will never be known.

                In this figure we are looking at the Cloudiness at specific cities whose location is given by a series
                of latitudinal and logitudinal coordinates. This is esssentially a plot depicting some 500+ cities and on a specific date 
                listed in the title, the cloudiness in those cities identified here by their latitudes, although without a longitude coordinate 
                the city wouldn't exist.  Unlike the Max. Temperature plot, there is not many observations to be made here.  We see cities/dots  
                representded all over the graph.  This tells us that the distribution of the dots/cities and how their respective Latitudinal 
                coordinates corelates to that day's cloudiness and in This case we make any intelligible comments about the data represented 
                here, with exception that maybe there is no corelation between a cities latitude and it's Cloudiness.

                In this figure we are looking at the Humidity on a dat within specific cities whose location is given by a series
                of latitudinal and logitudinal coordinates. This is esssentially a plot depicting one specific date in some 500+ cities      
                listed in the title, the humidity in those cities identified here by their latitudes.  Unlike the Max Temperature plot and more 
                like the Cloudiness plot, the data doesn't tell us that much.  Humidity mapped against latitude gives us a rather uninterestin plot.
                We sethe majority of cites around -40 deg to the south and to the north at approximately 75 deg latitude. That is one notable point but 
                also see that the majority of the cities have somewhere between 60% and 100% humidity. Yes many cities have lower humidities on this day
                but the MAJORITY is what we are concerned with.  Other cities have from 60% and decreasingly less cities have decreasing %humidities, 
                these however may be considered outliers, meaning they don't fit the general pattern which in this case isn't much of pattern.  Some of 
                these outliers fall to 0% humidity.  I'd love to experience what that is like, wouldn't you. So, again, we aren't given the best data here.
                One conclusion is that most of these cities on this day are experiencing a rather high % of humidity.

                In Similar fashion to the Cloudiness and the Humidity plots, there is not many, if any interesting observations
                to be made here regarding the correlation between the cities Latitudes and Wind-Speed at the locations. I see that the 
                majority of the cities have rather low wind speeds on this date.  Since there is no such thing as a negative wind speeds 
                we see that all the values are positive, or else we would be being sucked into some vacuum.  Most cities represented here 
                have wind-speeds of a typical day, inclement weather exempt, although I am not a meteorologist.  It seems the vast majority 
                of cities have wind-speeds between 0-15 mph maybe pushing the higher end up to 20 and saying those above are outliers.  
                We see no correlation between wind-speed and Latitude using this plot and these cities on this day.
